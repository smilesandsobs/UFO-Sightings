## Overview of Project: 

McMinnville, Oregon is famous for its UFO sightings and has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. Dana is a data journalist from McMinnville and has a javascrip file with sighting information which includes: County, State, Cities, type of sighting, etc. It is a very large file and the challenge was to use JavaScript to create filters for multiple criteria at the same time in addition to a local HTML page to make it clear and concise for users.   

## Results: 

In addition to filtering by date, we have added a table filters for the city, state, country, and shape allowing users to define their search criteria for whichever inquiry they are making:

Using the console we are able to double check that our search criteria is working correctly:

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.


## Summary: 

Our website is dynamic and functional. Users can search through over 100 different sighting events very quickly, if they know approximatly what to look for. If they don't know what is in the data, they likely need to skim it first to get a sense of what information is there. The most challenging search parameter would be SHAPE. A user would need to look through the dataset to know what the options are for shape. A dropdown menu would fix this issue quickly. Additionally, there is not a lot of analysis of the data. Additional summary statistics could be interesting for users, especially Dana to help her to figure out what her next story might be. 
Lastly, an additional search criteria could be to add DURATION. If the event lasted for over an hour or less than 15 min.
